title: How to get Help
---

This page lists resources for Augusta University students to receive help with their course of studies, [in general](#general), for [students of the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences](#school), and for [this course in particular](#course).

# In General {#general}

Many resources are available to help you be a successful student:

- If you are food insecure, [you are not alone](https://www.wjbf.com/csra-news/nearly-36-percent-of-college-students-are-hungry/), and the [Open Paws Food Pantry](https://www.augusta.edu/student-affairs/open-paws.php) will help you.
- For tutoring resources, consult the [Academic Success Center](https://www.augusta.edu/academicsuccess/) (or "ASC"). It can help you, among other things, in the areas of time management, test preparation and study strategies.
- [Student Counseling & Psychological Services](https://www.augusta.edu/counseling/) (or "SCAPS") is here to assist students with a variety of personal, developmental, and mental health concerns.
- The [Writing Center](https://www.augusta.edu/pamplin/writingcenter/) can help you with any written, oral, or multimedia project.
- To get help with technologies, refer to our [Instructional Technology Support](https://www.augusta.edu/continuity/index.php) correspondent [Sienna Sewell](https://spots.augusta.edu/sSewell/).
- The [Department of Multicultural Student Engagement (MSE)](https://www.augusta.edu/multicultural/) aims to provide education, training, and programming to foster awareness of diversity and inclusion among Augusta University students. Their [Multicultural Mentorship Program and African American Male Initiative](https://www.augusta.edu/multicultural/programming.php) are excellent resources to receive additional help.

## ACM Club

The [Augusta University chapter](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense) of the [A.C.M](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery") is one of the university's best resources for Computer Science, Information Technology and Cyber Security students.
It provides a platform to network with other students in similar majors, presenting countless opportunities to not only expand the people you know, but also a fantastic place to learn and ask questions.
To learn more, you can sign up for the newsletter, or attend one of the subgroup meetings (meeting times and locations are listed [on the website](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense)).

## Other Club Activities

The Augusta University Game Design Club and Girls Who Code College Loop "will be continuing activities in full force this year".  Notifications for upcoming activities will be shared in class alongside school-wide emails. 

# For This Course

## Commenting Using a Github Account

On this website, if [you look below](#how-is-this-page), you will see a box where you can comment.
This will require that you create a [Github account](https://github.com/login), which is free and may serve multiple purpose if you intend to study, use, or contribute to open-source projects.
The comment can use the [markdown syntax](https://commonmark.org/) (exactly like this resource!), which is also used on websites like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help) and extremely popular!

## How to Ask a Question?

It may seems silly, but asking a question "the right way" may not always be easy.

#. Once you've identified your issue, try again from scratch to see if you missed a point.
#. Go over the instructions, and [look in our resources](https://github.com/csci-1301/csci-1301.github.io/search?q=ask+a+question) for some meaningful keywords.
#. Think about how you can describe your issue, what is the shortest route to reproduce it.
#. If you are still facing difficulties, be detailed and clear about what you think went wrong: if the question is related to computers, specify which operating system, what you have tried, the exact nature of the error message, etc. Screenshots are not always the right way to convey your question: try to be descriptive, and explain what you tried. If you want to refer to a particular lab or lecture, open the corresponding page, look for the closest title, hover over it, and you should see a "§" symbol appears: click on it, you can now [share that link](https://www.wikihow.com/Copy-and-Paste-a-Link) so that your interlocutor knows precisely what you are talking about!

And, remember: your instructor(s) knows that you are a student and here to learn, so you should _never_ feel intimidated or assume that _everyone knows better than you_: many students struggle in this class at times, and you could actually do them all a favor by asking your instructor(s) to go over a particular dimension that they may have overlooked or explained poorly!
